## ðŸ§  Neuropixels Corticoâ€“Striatal Analysis Pipeline

### Overview

This repository contains a **MATLAB-based analysis pipeline** developed for *in vivo* Neuropixels electrophysiological recordings.
It was designed to quantify **corticoâ€“striatal synchronization**, **spikeâ€“LFP coupling**, and **SWD/IID event dynamics** in *Scn2a*-deficient mice.

The code supports preprocessing, event detection, and visualization of large-scale multi-channel recordings, and was used to generate Neuropixels figures in the manuscript:

> *Corticoâ€“striatal desynchronization underlies seizure susceptibility in Scn2a-deficient mice* (Zhao et al., in preparation)

---

### Features

* **Preprocessing and baseline correction**
  Removes 60 Hz noise, performs detrending and bandpass filtering (0.5â€“250 Hz).
* **SWD/IID event detection**
  Peak-based algorithm with Hilbert envelope alignment for precise onset identification.
* **Spikeâ€“LFP integration**
  Aligns single-unit spike times to SWD windows for rate and phase analysis.
* **Region and neuron classification**
  Automatically labels units by recording depth and waveform type (Ctx, Str, Pal, MSN, FSI, UIN).
* **Visualization**
  Generates event-centered LFP traces, raster plots, and PETHs for cortical vs. striatal comparison.
* **Data export**
  Outputs `.mat` and `.xlsx` results for reproducibility and figure generation.

### Usage

```matlab
% Example: Detect SWD events and visualize
lfp_data = load('example_data/LFP_mouse01.mat');
swd_events = detect_swd_v3(lfp_data);

% Compute cortical and striatal rates
[rate_CTX, rate_STR] = compute_rate_CTX_STR(swd_events);

% Export to Excel
export_results(rate_CTX, rate_STR, 'output.xlsx');
```
